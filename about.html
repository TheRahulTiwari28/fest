                <p>Under the inspiration and guidance of late Shri Gurudayal Malikji, and advocate saint – who stood for idealism in the children – both these institutions served the Gujarati society for a good number of years. However, both these institutions had teething trouble of overcoming financial stringencies and various other difficulties. For administrative convenience, financial stability and to facilitate the student’s right from Montessori to Secondary on a gradual scale both these institutions were amalgamated in the year 1946 with a decision that the same should be managed by “KHAR EDUCATION SOCIETY”.
                    <br>At this very time a capital donation was received from Messrs Maganlal Maneklal Sonawala & Co. and the management of “Khar Education Society (KES)” gave impetus to our present changed name of “SHREE M.M. PUPILS OWN SCHOOL AND SHARDA MANDIR”. KES was fortunate to have valuable selfless services of late Gurudayal Malikji and Smt. Vimlaben Setalwad, who used to take personal interest in the regular management as well as upliftment and expansion of school. They also contributed their time in the collection of funds as well. We should also make special mention of Shri Chottubhai Marfatia who also rendered worthwhile services for our institution.
